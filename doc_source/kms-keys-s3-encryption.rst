Using |KMS| Keys with the AmazonS3EncryptionClient in the |sdk-net|
###################################################################

The :sdk-net-api:`AmazonS3EncryptionClient <S3/TS3EncryptionClient>` class implements the
same interface as the standard :code:`AmazonS3Client`. This means it's easy to switch to the :code:`AmazonS3EncryptionClient`
class. In fact, your application code won't be aware of the encryption and decryption happening automatically
in the client.

You can use an |KMS| key as your master key when you use the :code:`AmazonS3EncryptionClient` class for
client-side encryption. All you have to do is create an :code:`EncryptionMaterials` object that contains
a KMS key ID. Then you pass the :code:`EncryptionMaterials` object to the constructor of the
:code:`AmazonS3EncryptionClient`.

The main advantage of using an |KMS| key as your master key is that you don't need to store and manage
your own master keys. It's done by AWS. A second advantage is that it makes the |sdk-net|'s :code:`AmazonS3EncryptionClient`
class interoperable with the |sdk-java|'s :code:`AmazonS3EncryptionClient` class.  This means you can
encrypt with the |sdk-java| and decrypt with the |sdk-net|, and vice versa.

.. note::

    The |sdk-net|'s :code:`AmazonS3EncryptionClient` supports KMS master keys only when run in metadata
    mode. The instruction file mode of the |sdk-net|'s :code:`AmazonS3EncryptionClient` is still incompatible
    with the |sdk-java|'s :code:`AmazonS3EncryptionClient`.

For more information about client-side encryption with the AmazonS3EncryptionClient class, and how envelope encryption works, see `Client Side Data Encryption with AWS SDK for .NET and Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/client-side-data-encryption-with-aws-sdk-for-net-and-amazon-s3/>`_.

The following example demonstrates how to use |KMS| keys with the AmazonS3EncryptionClient class. Your project must reference the latest version of the :code:`AWSSDK.KeyManagementService` Nuget package to use this feature.
Don't forget to set the :code:`region`, :code:`bucketName`, and :code:`objectKey` variables to appropriate values.
